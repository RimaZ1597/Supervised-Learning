    "# Estimating Regression Coefficients Using Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the relationship between the response variable $y$ and the predictor $X$ is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = b_0 + b_1X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $b_0$ represents the intercept (the value of $y$ when $X$ is zero) and $b_1$ represents the slope (the change in $y$ for a unit change in $X$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find the coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, where a residual is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The least squares estimates can be derived by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $n$ is the number of observations, $y_i$ is the observed value of the response variable for the $i$-th observation, and $x_i$ is the value of the predictor for the $i$-th observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimize the RSS, we take partial derivatives of RSS with respect to $b_0$ and $b_1$ and set them to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial b_1} = -2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i(y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i)) = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial b_0} = -2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i)) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these equations, we can solve for $b_1$ and $b_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\overline{x})(y_i - \\overline{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}$$\n",
    "$$b_0 = \\overline{y} - b_1\\overline{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\overline{x}$ and $\\overline{y}$ represent the means of $X$ and $y$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's implement the least squares method in Python to estimate the regression coefficients.\n",
